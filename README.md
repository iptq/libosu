General-purpose osu! library

Installation
------------

This package is hosted on [crates.io][1]. In order to include this library into
your project, simply add this line into your `Cargo.toml`:

```rust
libosu = "*"
```

The following features are available through adding features in `Cargo.toml`,
and are not included by default since they may bring in extra dependencies:

- `apiv1`: Bindings for the osu! API v1.
- `apiv2`: Bindings for the osu! API v2.
- `replay-data`: Action data for osu! replay files (requires LZMA).

Getting Started
---------------

Check out the [API Documentation][2] for details on how to use the various
functions, or check out some of the examples (pending).
